When my end-term examination ended I was wondering how to utilize my first month long vacation.  I had many ideas but none of them was interesting enough to continue month long, when I got to know of SDSLabs woc I thought it would be wonderful opportunity to utilize my free time

[SDSLabs](https://sdslabs.co/) *Winter of Code* (abbreviated as **woc**) is a program organized SDSLabs for first and second year students to encourage open source contribution and preparing them for GSoC.

A proposal for new project or changes (and addition) to an existing projects of SDSLabs was expected from those who wished to participate for woc 2016. Proposal is a brief overview of features one is going to implement and contains use cases along with other details of the project of the project. Proposal also contained a small portion explaining skills and a brief background of the applicant. On the lines of GSoc, woc has similar pattern of evaluation. Of the many proposals they received only few were judging on various criteria, this was the most competitive part of the program. A mentor is assigned to each participant to help him/her through the project. Evaluation of the work done is in two stages: mid-term evaluation and end term evaluation.

My experience with woc 2016 was one of the most enlightening experiences of my life. I developed [Clipboarder](suyashmahar.github.io/Clipboarder) a clipboard manager for Windows using C# and .NET 4. My mentor [Dhaval Kapil](https://dhavalkapil.com/) was extremely helpful and supportive during entire period of 4 weeks. Despite being busy he helped me a lot by suggesting and advising on features. 

My project aim was to create a simple yet powerful clipboard manager which would allow user to access older content from clipboard. Clipboarder would be helpful in data intensive scenarios such as filling a form using [Fake Name Generator](fakenamegenerator.com) or saving content that is quickly accessible for future use. It was very interesting to work on idea would make others life easier.

Coding period began on 3 December. In fact I had done many parts of the application during my +2 years as a hobby project. So I started project by adding a release of all the existing features to GitHub. The program was until then written in VB. But following my mentor's advice I switched from to C# and developed a complete design for the application. Designing of the application included decisions like choosing encryption algorithm and appropriate database type. Once the design of the app was ready I started implementing everything. Though most of the features took expected time to complete, working with database was the most challenging part. I completed my application in few days earlier then expected so at the end I wrote a brief description of the application and organized code to make it more readable.

The more I developed this application the more I got interested in it. I learned a very broad spectrum of things while developing this application this included Lambda expressions, RegEx, managing SQLite Database, MVP architecture and using P/Invoke to call un-managed APIs. 

Overall Winter of Code was very exciting experience, I wouldn't be able to learn so many new things and meet awesome people if I didn't participated in it.
